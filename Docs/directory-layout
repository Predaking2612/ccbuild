Root Directory (Running script will generate a folder named 'CalcOs'). Idea is similar to using 'cargo init'. This will create 4 (+ 1) subdirectories
within CalcOs: Poky, CalcOs-Kern, PhiX-CPP, PhiX, and Result.

Obviously this directories won't just appear out of nowhere. This will be
generated by 'fetch'

NOTE: Execute this in a separate directory
